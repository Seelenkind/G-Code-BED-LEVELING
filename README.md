# G-CODE for Bed leveling for 3D Printers

Start the G-code as usual as a printout.
Each time the button is pressed, the nozzle moves to the next position (4 corners then to the center) and performs Z-homing. Then it goes up to 0.04 mm.
Carry out bedleveling with a sheet of paper so it scratches easily when moving.
Now a distance between bed and nozzles of paper thickness minus 0.04 mm is set.
Activate the skirt when printing and watch the lines to see if they are neatly placed (no thick sausage, no flat-printed line)
Have fun printing with the perfectly leveled bed.
